---CROSSWORD PUZZLE---

DESCRIPTION
A program coded in Python that accepted a list of words and used two-dimensional arrays to print the words onto a visual crossword puzzle, following the legal placement rules required

LEGAL WORD PLACEMENT
  i. All of the word W lies on the 20x20 grid;
  ii. If W is not the first word, then W must intersect with one or more words on the grid;
  iii. The placement of W must not create any new 'words', 
      - W cannot be adjacent to any letter which is not in the word(s) with which W intersects.
